Limbus Clash Calculator

After noticing the values on the clash indicator were being mislabled, especially notable with negative coin users, i decided to recreate the present calculation and for comparison, create the actual clash calculator.

To use this calculator, run the GUI.py file, and you will be prompted to input the files needed to calculate the clash, outputting both old and new values.
